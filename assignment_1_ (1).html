<h1>Finishing Assignment 1!</h1>

<h2>Convention for file names</h2>
<p>The reason file names are saved as they are so the web browser can parse the request
correctly. Saving a file name such as this one as &quot;assignment_1_IT130_html&quot; will be able to be read by the
browser, you cannot save the file name with normal spaces because _ is how the browser accepts spaces.
Secondly, making sure ending your file name with &quot;.html&quot; so the web server knows the type of document 
to present</p> 

<h2>Purpose of assignment checklist</h2>
<p>the purpose of the assignment checklist is to help students keep track of videos, quizzes, and 
assignments. This checklist is different than the one on d2l submissions because It helps students 
go through the class smoother and being able to check off things as they complete them with additional 
information such as video lengths, where to access or what software to be using.</p>

<h2>Web accounts on a web server</h2>
<p>the reason a person would need an account on a web server to display their web pages.
When a request is made through a web client the web server reads the request and sends HTTP response.
Without having a account with a web server, an error would pop up to the person using the web client 
making the request.</p>

<h2>News postings subscriptions</h2>
<p>the importance of subscribing to News postings is to receive the most up to date announcements
for our course from our professor. To confirm I am signed up, I not only receive emails but notifications 
in d2l&#39;s homepage in the upper right hand corner</p>

<h2>Which quiz attempt is recorded?</h2>
<p>Your first quiz attempt is recorded except for the syllabus quiz. The reason for this is because 
after the quiz finished the answers are shown. Two of your lowest quizzes are dropped at the end of 
the course.</p>

<h2>policy of uploading assignments to Chegg</h2>
<p>If a student is caught uploading a assignment to a tutorial website is &quot;providing unauthorized 
assitance&quot; which is not allowed by the committee and any students who share or posting that information 
will be subject to sanctions</p>
