<h3> Why is whitespace important when writing code</h3>

<p> The reason whitespace exists is to make your coding easier 
    to interpret if collegues or anyone is looking at your coding 
    lines. Whitespace can be too much of a good thing, do not 
    over use whitespace but use it when needed to define where
    certain coding lines start and when they end.
</p>

<h3>Defining the Academic Integrity Policy </h3>

<p> Topics that cover what is allowed and isn&#39;t allowed for when 
    seeking assitance from others such as Google&#174;, other students
    or tutors are as following. Asking for help from a colleague or tutor
    to help you work out a bug is acceptable. When they 
    basically do the problem or issue for you that is when 
    it becomes a problem. If a few students help eachother
    and the assignment of all look similar that can be cause for issue.
    Each student should be turning in a unique assignment.
